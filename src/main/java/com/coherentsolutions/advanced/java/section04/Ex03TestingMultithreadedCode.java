// Summary
// --------------------
// - Design thread-safe classes by following key principles such as minimizing shared mutability and using synchronization appropriately.
// - Balance concurrency and resource utilization to avoid performance issues like thread contention and overhead.
// - Use tools like `ExecutorService`, stress testing, and frameworks like JCStress to effectively test multithreaded code.

// Up Next: Weâ€™ll dive into more advanced concurrency utilities and patterns to build highly scalable applications!
