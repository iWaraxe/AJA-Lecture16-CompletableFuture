// Summary
// --------------------
// - The `Future` interface, while useful, has limitations due to its blocking nature and difficulty in composing tasks.
// - `CompletableFuture` was introduced in Java 8 to provide a more powerful and flexible way to handle asynchronous tasks.
// - With `CompletableFuture`, we can run non-blocking tasks, compose multiple tasks, and handle asynchronous computation more elegantly.

// Up Next: Weâ€™ll dive deeper into the various features of `CompletableFuture`, such as task composition, exception handling, and combining multiple asynchronous tasks.
