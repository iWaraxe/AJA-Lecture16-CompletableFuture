// Summary
// --------------------
// - Advanced synchronization techniques like `ReadWriteLock` and `StampedLock` help improve performance by allowing multiple readers while restricting writers.
// - Thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentHashMap` and `CopyOnWriteArrayList` simplify multithreaded programming by handling synchronization internally.
// - Best practices, including immutability, thread confinement, and avoiding deadlocks, are crucial for writing robust concurrent applications.

// Up Next: Weâ€™ll explore how to use advanced concurrency utilities like ForkJoinPool and Phaser!
